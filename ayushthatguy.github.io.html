  <p>And last but not least a snake uses its venom to improve its health.While using venom on yourself might seem dangerous to a snake,but its actually hormal to mostly all snakes because it uses it to digest after it finishes eating its meal, and can help dismantle tissues and prepares to eat and make the food slowly but surely digest.</p> </div>
