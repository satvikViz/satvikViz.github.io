    <p>Snakes employ venom as a highly efficient tool for subduing prey, often through a precise strike and immediate release. This strategy minimizes the risk of injury to the snake from struggling prey. The venom, a complex cocktail of proteins and enzymes, rapidly incapacitates the victim. Depending on the snake species, venom can act as a neurotoxin, disrupting the nervous system and causing paralysis, or as a hemotoxin, breaking down tissues and affecting blood coagulation, leading to internal bleeding. After the venom takes effect and the prey is immobilized, the snake uses its keen sense of smell, often aided by its forked tongue and Jacobson's organ, to track and locate the envenomated animal before swallowing it whole.</p>
